# Teach&Learn

## Description
In progress...

Teach&Learn is an application that allows students to sign up and request tutors based on requested subject, financial affordability, and location. As a tutor you will be able to create a profile to present your credentials, biography, cost per hour, availability, and subjects you offer tutoring in. 

Online tutoring services can be costly for families and tutors may only get a small cut of the cost per hour. This app is meant to be more accessible and provide flexibility for both tutors and students! 

## Technologies
Built with React and currently being styled using vanilla CSS; graphQL and apollo/client.
